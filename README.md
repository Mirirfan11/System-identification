# System-Identification-Using-NARX-Neural-Network

The use of Nonlinear Autoregressive with Exogeneous Inputs with Neural Networks applied to dynamic system such as Mass-Spring-Damper System in both forward and inverse problem, mapping a relationship between input force and output displacement amplitudes. The data is obtained by solving linear 1D equation of motion using ODE45 solver in MATLAB.
